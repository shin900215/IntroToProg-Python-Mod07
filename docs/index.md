##Assignment 07: Pickling and Structured Error Handling

###Introduction
In this assignment, pickling and structured error handling are described. The pickling example described in the textbook will be used to describe the pickling, and the structured error handling are shown at the end of this assignment. 
Using the pickling, the variety, the shape, and the brand of the pickles will be separately stored then combined. Once the pickling is done, a data file will be created that contains all the data in it. When the pickling example is done, the script used in this assignment will ask the user if the user would like to see any of the variety, shape, or the brand of the pickle. When the user input is not valid, the prompt will show up and tell the user that the input is not correct.
